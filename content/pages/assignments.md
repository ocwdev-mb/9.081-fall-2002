These two assignments together constitute 70% of the grade for this class.

Assignment 1: Research Paper Presentation
-----------------------------------------

Each student will briefly (20-30 minutes) present recent neuroimaging papers and will lead group discussion at multiple points during the term.

The objectives of the presentation are to consider:

*   Motivation
*   Methods
*   Results
*   Implications

The purpose is to initiate the day's discussion of this and the related assigned articles.

Assignment 2: Experimental Research Proposal
--------------------------------------------

This proposal should advance a novel neuroimaging investigation aimed to address any aspect of memory considered during the course.

The proposal (approx. 10-15 pages) should describe:

*   The background
*   Experimental design
*   Analysis approach
*   Predicted results
*   Theoretical implications

Proposals will be due on the last day of class and will be briefly presented (~15 minutes) during the final class meeting.
